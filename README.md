In the last assignment hopefully, you have crawled the information below:

<ul>

 <li>Movie Name</li>

 <li>Director</li>

 <li>Writers</li>

 <li>Producer</li>

 <li>Original Language</li>

 <li>Cast with the character name</li>

 <li>Storyline</li>

 <li>Box Office Collection</li>

 <li>Runtime</li>

</ul>

<strong><u>Task 1:</u> </strong>

Along with the above information, you need to add the following information:

<ul>

 <li>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE – Similar kind of movie suggestions</li>

 <li>WHERE TO WATCH – Online platforms where the movie can be seen.</li>

</ul>

So if user input is &lt;YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE&gt;, then you should print the similar movies with &lt;Movie X&gt;, and wait for user input from the listed movies and again present the same options list.

Similarly for the sake of completion, if user input is &lt;WHERE TO WATCH&gt;, then you should print the available online platforms where the movie is streaming.

<strong><u>Task 2:</u> </strong>

Expand the cast member functionality for a movie in the below way:

Given a movie and user input for a cast member, as per the last assignment print all of its cast members, then wait for user input of any one of the listed cast member, given the input you need to download and save that actor/actress profile and write grammar to extract the below fields:

<ul>

 <li>Highest Rated film</li>

 <li>Lowest Rated film</li>

 <li>Birthday</li>

 <li>His/Her other movies</li>

</ul>

Then wait for the user to select from any of the above options and show the result as per selection and for the ‘His/Her other movies’ further ask for a year and use it as a filter to show all the movies on or after that year.
